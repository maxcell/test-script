## Prince's rough script for Netlify Build migration

This is a rough script made to ensure users can quickly migrate their sites without manually going to every site. Before using this program, go into `index.js` and replace the `accessToken` value with your own access token.

From there, install your dependencies (`npm install`) and you can then run the script with `npm run start`.
